## Usage

> Requirements file is empty, so there are no dependencies, will add some for potential database functionality later. It will prompt you how many characters your password is.  The number can be between 8 and 20 (inclusive)
> 
> There are all 26 letters, lower and uppercase, all 10 digits (0-9) and most special characters available for use. Instead of prompting to ask which are available, just made it default with those.
> 
> Run the below command to execute the script.

```shell
python3 main.py
```
or if you are on windows
```shell
python main.py
```
